## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  It packs up code for reuse throughout a program, it makes code easier to read, and makes codes dynamic.
- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  The function keyword, an optional name sayHello, a comma separated list of parameters, a code block with open curly braces, an optional return statement and closed curly braces.
- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  A function needs to b called for the code block to run. We call the function name and add parentheses.

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  when a function is called, we pass the argument into the function name. A function definition allows for the name and placeholder parameters.

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  Parameters are placeholders and the argument is what is being called for the code to run.
- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  Parameter is a placeholder. its variable is not known until we call the function and pass the argument. When the functions code block is run, the parameter will be holding the value of the argument.
- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  Causes the function to produce a value we can use in our program, prevents any mmore code in the functions code block from being run.

- What is the syntax for defining an arrow function?
  const greeting(Param)=>value
- When an arrow function's body is not surrounded in curly braces (_concise body syntax_), what changes in its functionality?
  the function keywords is not used and the arrow is used between the parameter and code block. Having an implicit return means that an arrow function can return a value without using the return keyword.
